This is a starter with react, redux, bootstrap, reactstrap, hot module realoder, react-hot-reloader and sass.

Install dependencies.

`yarn install`

Watches for file changes and compiles.

`yarn dev`

Note: this was only a test in order to learn how webpack works, this shouldn't be used in production, prefer a battle tested solution like CRA, Next, or something of the sorts.
